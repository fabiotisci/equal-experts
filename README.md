## Equal Experts Coding challenge

Simple calculator implementation. I have used Reat with TS, I didn't use any HTML templating framework (bootstrap, material, fundation) as I think it was a bit pointless for a calculator.
To use the calculator you must click on the calculator keys, typing in the input isn't allowed.
Only Addition, Substraction, Clr and Del functionality is implemented, so during the pair programing the rest of the functionality can be added


There are possible improvements like dealing with really long calculations, there a few solutions but that would take a bit longer to implement ... or allowing the user to use keys pressed to improve usability,
